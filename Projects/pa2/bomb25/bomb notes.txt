phase 2

phase 3
first number is 0, put other 5, do i r to see next number. Do this until all 6 numbers found
____________________________________________________________________________________________

phase 4
obvious first int is 3-6
second int 574 b/c 0x23e compared to second int
run that with wrong char and inspect al (p $al) and get 121. 121 in ascii is y
ans = 3 y 574

second to last cmp says edx must be 3 or bomb explodes. Look at loop of assembly
int a = input1;
int b = input2;

if(a != 15){
  int ecx = 0;
  int edx = 0;
 
  do{
     edx++;
     a = array[a]
     ecd = ecx + a;
  }while(a != 15);

  if(d == 3 && c == b)
     return;
}

 call explode_bomb;

looking over this, we can only loop 3 times because of d == 3, find an index of array where
when d == 3, a == 5.
This is index 4 which goes to index 4, 9, 14.

input1 = 4;

add up values of the three index which will equal input 2.

input2 = 9 + 14 + 15 = 38

Final ans = 4 38

phase 6
call is 6 numbers, and cant be the same from 1-6
it's a linked list so you have to find the value of the 6 nodes, looking at the strings of the code, the 6 nodes are called node1... node6
p/s node1 and all other nodes and store them
sort the nodes from smallest to greatest and that is the input
